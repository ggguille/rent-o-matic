# Rent-o-Matic

The goal of our Rent-o-Matic project is to create a simple search engine for a company that rents rooms. Objects in the dataset (rooms) are described by several attributes. Our search engine will allow the user to set filters to narrow their search according to these attributes.

A room is stored in the system with the following values:

- A unique identifier.
- Size in square feet.
- Price to rent in USD per day.
- Latitude and longitude.

The description is minimal by design so that we can focus on the architectural problems and their solutions. The concepts that weâ€™ll see can easily be extended to more complex cases.
